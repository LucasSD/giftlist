# Introduction

The aim of this project is to create a website to assist my family in creating gift lists for Christmas, birthdays and other occasions. Each family member can create their own list, providing specific details of the gift they would like. 
Each family can also view the lists of others, and can choose a gift to buy that person. Other buyers will know that that gift has been taken by someone else, and will have to select another. Receivers wil not be able too see
which gifts they will receive.
